# Setting up Astro with Extensions for local development

Follow these steps to set up Astro with Starlight and additional extensions:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**
   
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Fork the documentation-hostly repository and open the folder in a code editor**
   
3. **Install Dependencies**
   
   Run the following command inside the local repository:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Optional: Install the Astro and MDX VS Code extension**
   
   Install the Astro and MDX VS Code extension to get syntax highlighting and other useful features:
   - [Astro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode)
   - [MDX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx)

5. **Run your Astro site**
   
   Start the development server by running the following command inside the local repository:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start a local server and give you a URL to preview your changes.

6. **Create your contribution**
   
   Either edit a markdown file in the `src/content/docs/` directory or create a new `.mdx` file in the `src/content/docs/` directory and start writing your docs article.


7. **Create a Pull Request**

   Create a new pull request from your forked repository to the main documentation-hostly repository.
