## FAQ
### How to increase the upload size limit?

You can increase the upload size limit by following these steps:

1. Open the `.htaccess` file through Hostly's Terminal (or through SSH, and docker exec -ti `container_id` /bin/bash)
2. Add the following lines to the end of the file with `vi` or `nano`:

```
# END WordPress - this line already exists in the file

php_value upload_max_filesize 256M
php_value post_max_size 256M
php_value max_execution_time 300
php_value max_input_time 300
```

3. Save and close the file.
4. Reload the website in your browser. The changes should be applied automatically.
