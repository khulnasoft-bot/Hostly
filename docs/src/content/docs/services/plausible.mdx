## How to deploy Plausible Analytics with Hostly?

## Installation

2. Copy the following [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khulnasoft/hostly/main/templates/compose/plausible.yaml) into the input box (with the comments).
3. Click on the `Save` button.
4. Go to the `Plausible` service's settings page (`Settings` button on the right side).
5. Add your custom domain to the `Domains` input box (you can also edit the domains by clicking on the edit icon next to the autogenerated domain).
6. Click on the `Save` button.
7. Click on the `Deploy` button and wait for the deployment to finish.
