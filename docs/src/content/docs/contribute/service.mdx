Services in Hostly are templates made from normal [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/) files with some added Hostly magic.

<Aside type="note">
  See [Hostly's docker-compose specs](/docs/knowledge-base/docker/compose#hostlys-magic-environment-variables) to learn more about Hostly's magic and how to benefit from generated variables and storage handling. Please use this magic when submitting your PR to make the merging process smoother.

<Steps>

1. Add metadata

   At the top of your `docker-compose` file, add the following metadata:

   ```yaml
   # documentation: https://docs.example.com/
   # slogan: A brief description of your service.
   # tags: tag1,tag2,tag3
   # logo: svgs/your-service.svg
   # port: 1234
   ```

   - `documentation`: Link to the service's official documentation
   - `slogan`: A short description of the service
   - `tags`: Comma-separated list for better searchability
   - `logo`: Path to the service's logo (see step 3)
   - `port`: The main entrypoint port of the service

   <Aside type="caution">
     Always specify a port, as Caddy Proxy cannot automatically determine the service's port.
   </Aside>

2. Create the docker-compose file

   Below the metadata, add your docker-compose configuration. Use Hostly's environment variable magic [here](/docs/knowledge-base/docker/compose#hostlys-magic-environment-variables).

   Example:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     app:
       image: your-service-image:tag
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=${HOSTLY_DATABASE_URL}
       volumes:
         - ${HOSTLY_VOLUME_APP}:/data
   ```

3. Add a logo

   - Create or obtain an SVG logo for your service (strongly preferred format)
   - If SVG is unavailable, use a high-quality PNG or JPG as a last resort
   - Add the logo file to the `svgs` folder in the Hostly repository
   - The logo filename should match the docker-compose service name exactly
     - For example, if your service name is `wordpress`, your logo should be `wordpress.svg` and the final path then is `svgs/wordpress.svg` use this path in the `logo` metadata.


4. Test your template

   Use the `Docker Compose` deployment option in Hostly to test your template. This process mimics the one-click service deployment.

5. Submit a Pull Request

   Once your template works correctly:
   - Open a [PR](https://github.com/khulnasoft/hostly/compare)
   - Add your new `<service>.yaml` compose file under `/templates/compose`
   - Include the logo file in the `svgs` folder

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Hostly uses a [parsed version](https://github.com/khulnasoft/hostly/blob/main/templates/service-templates.json) of the templates for deployment.

## Request a new service

If there's a service template you'd like to see in Hostly:

1. Search [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/khulnasoft/hostly/discussions/categories/new-service-integrations) for existing requests.
2. If the service has been requested, upvote it. If not, create a new request.
