To uninstall the self-hosted version of Hostly from your server, follow these steps:

1. **Stop and Remove Containers:**

   Use the following command to stop the Hostly containers with a timeout of 0, ensuring they stop immediately, and then remove them:

   ```bash
   sudo docker stop -t 0 hostly hostly-realtime hostly-db hostly-redis hostly-proxy
   sudo docker rm hostly hostly-realtime hostly-db hostly-redis hostly-proxy
   ```

2. **Remove Docker Volumes:**

   Execute the command below to remove the Docker volumes associated with Hostly:

   ```bash
   sudo docker volume rm hostly-db hostly-redis
   ```

3. **Remove Docker Network:**

   Remove the custom Docker network named "hostly":

   ```bash
   sudo docker network rm hostly
   ```

4. **Delete Hostly Data Directory:**

   Delete the directory where Hostly data is stored:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /data/hostly
   ```

5. **Remove Docker Images:**

   Use the following commands to remove the Docker images used by Hostly:

   ```bash
   sudo docker rmi ghcr.io/khulnasoft/hostly:latest
   sudo docker rmi ghcr.io/khulnasoft/hostly-helper:latest
   sudo docker rmi quay.io/soketi/soketi:1.6-16-alpine
   sudo docker rmi postgres:15-alpine
   sudo docker rmi redis:alpine

   sudo docker rmi traefik:v3.1  # when using the default proxy
   sudo docker rmi lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy:2.8-alpine  # when you have switched proxy to Caddy
   
   ```

After completing these steps, Hostly will be uninstalled from your server.
