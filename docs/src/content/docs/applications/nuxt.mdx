[Example repository.](https://github.com/khulnasoft/hostly/tree/main/examples/tree/main/nuxt)

## Server build (Nuxt, using `nuxt build`)

- Set `Build Pack` to `nixpacks`.
- Set Start Command to `node .output/server/index.mjs`

Alternatively, you can set the `start` script inside package.json to `node .output/server/index.mjs`. Then Nixpacks will automatically use it as the start command.

## Static build (Nuxt, using `nuxt generate`)

- Set `Build Pack` to `nixpacks`.
- Enable `Is it a static site?`.
- Set `Output Directory` to `dist`.

## Nitro server build (Nitro, using `nitro build`)

- Set `Build Pack` to `nixpacks`.
- Set Start Command to `node .output/server/index.mjs`

Alternatively, you can set the `start` script inside package.json to `node .output/server/index.mjs`. Then Nixpacks will automatically use it as the start command.
