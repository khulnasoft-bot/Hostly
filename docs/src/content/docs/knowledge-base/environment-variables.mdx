You can define environment variables for your resources, and they will be available in your application.

> Preview Deployments could have different environment variables, so you can test your application as a staging environment for example.

## Build Time Variables

If you would like to set environment variables for the build process, you can do it by setting the checkbox `Build Variable` in the normal view on the UI.

## Shared Variables

You could have 3 types of shared variables:

1. Team Based
2. Project Based
3. Environment Based (production, staging, etc.)

You can set shared variables on their respective pages.

Then you can use these variables anywhere. For example: You defined `NODE_ENV` to `production`.

### Team Based

You can set them on the `Team` page and use it with `{{team.NODE_ENV}}`. Do not replace "team" with your actual team name.

### Project Based

You can set them on the `Projects` page, under the gear icon and use it with `{{project.NODE_ENV}}`. Do not replace "project" with your actual project name.

### Environment Based

You can set them on the `Environments` page (select a `Project`), under the gear icon and use it with `{{environment.NODE_ENV}}`. Do not replace "environment" with your actual environment name.

#### Using Shared Variables in Compose File
If you want to use the environment variables in your compose file, you can do so by using the following syntax:

```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV}
```
And then in the UI set `NODE_ENV` to your desired shared variable. For example if you want to use a team based variable (make sure you have the `NODE_ENV` variable set in the Team Variables):
```
NODE_ENV=${team.NODE_ENV}
```

## Predefined Variables

Hostly predefines some variables for you, so you can use them in your application. All you need to do is to add an environment variable like this to your application.

```bash
# For example, you can use this variable in your application
MY_VARIABLE=$SOURCE_COMMIT
# You will have the commit hash of the source code in your application as an environment variable in MY_VARIABLE
```

### `HOSTLY_FQDN`

Fully qualified domain name(s) of the application.

### `HOSTLY_URL`

URL(s) of the application.

### `HOSTLY_BRANCH`

Branch name of the source code.

### `HOSTLY_CONTAINER_NAME`

Name of the container generated by Hostly.

### `SOURCE_COMMIT`

Commit hash of the source code.

### `PORT`

If not set: it is set to the `Port Exposes`'s first port.

### `HOST`

If not set: it is set to `0.0.0.0`.
