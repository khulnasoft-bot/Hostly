By default, the Traefik dashboard is enabled in secure mode, but not configured to be accessible from the internet.

To enable access from the internet, you need to add a dynamic configuration and secure it with a username and password.

## Secure mode (with Dynamic Configuration)

<Aside type="tip">
  How to configure Traefik's dynamic configuration? [Read
  more](/docs/knowledge-base/traefik/dynamic-configurations)
</Aside>

You can enable Traefik's dashboard by adding the following dynamic configuration:

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    dashboard:
      rule: Host(`<DOMAIN_FOR_TRAEFIK>`) && (PathPrefix(`/dashboard`) || PathPrefix(`/api`))
      service: api@internal
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
      middlewares:
        - auth
  middlewares:
    auth:
      basicAuth:
        users:
          - "<GENERATED_USERNAME>:<GENERATED_PASSWORD>"
```

Replace `<DOMAIN_FOR_TRAEFIK>`, `<GENERATED_USERNAME>`, and `<GENERATED_PASSWORD>` with your own values.

You can reach the dashboard by visiting `http://<DOMAIN_FOR_TRAEFIK>/dashboard/#/`.

### How to generate user/password?

You can generate one with the [htpasswd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html) command:

```bash
htpasswd -nbB test test
```

Example output:

```bash
test:$apr1$H6uskkkW$IgXLP6ewTrSuBkTrqE8wj/
```

## Insecure Mode (Not Recommended)

If you want to enable the dashboard in insecure mode (without a password), all you need to do is go to the proxy configurations view and change the `insecure` setting to `true`, then restart the proxy..

```yaml
   - '--api.insecure=true'
```
