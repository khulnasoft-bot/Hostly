If you want to use custom SSL certificates with Traefik, you can easily do so by following the steps below.

On each server, `/data/hostly/proxy` is mounted into the Hostly Proxy (Traefik) container.

You can add your custom SSL certificates in the `/data/hostly/proxy/certs` directory.

<Steps>
1.  Generate or request an SSL certificate for your domain. It can be a
    self-signed certificate, a certificate from a public CA, or a certificate
    from Let's Encrypt.

    Read more [here](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions) about certbot and Let's Encrypt.

2.  Copy the key and cert files to the server where your resource that will use the certificate is running.
    Use `scp` or any other method to copy the files.
    
    It should be placed under `/data/hostly/proxy` directory, for example:
    
    ```bash
    scp /path/to/your/domain.cert root@your-server-ip:/data/hostly/proxy/certs/domain.cert
    scp /path/to/your/domain.key root@your-server-ip:/data/hostly/proxy/certs/domain.key
    ```

    <Aside type="tip">
    Make sure the directory `/data/hostly/proxy/certs` exists on the server.
    </Aside>

3. Configure Traefik
    You can configure Traefik to use the custom SSL certificates by adding a dynamic configuration file through Hostly's UI or directly adding it to `/data/hostly/proxy/dynamic`:

    ```yaml
    tls:
      certificates:
        - certFile: /traefik/certs/domain.cert
          keyFile: /traefik/certs/domain.key
        - certFile: /traefik/certs/domain2.cert
          keyFile: /traefik/certs/domain2.key
    ```

    <Aside type="tip">
      `/traefik` is the directory inside `hostly-proxy` container where
      `/data/hostly/proxy` is mounted.
    </Aside>

    Traefik will automatically use this certificate if it matches the domain of the incoming request and the certificate in any of the provided files.

</Steps>
