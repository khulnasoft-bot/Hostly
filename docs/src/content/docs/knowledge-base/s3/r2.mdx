Cloudflare R2 is an S3 compatible storage. You can use it with Hostly to store your backups.

# Configuration

1. You need to create a bucket first in the Cloudflare R2 dashboard.
2. Then you need to create a R2 API token with `Object Read & Write` permission.
3. You can find the S3 client credentials when the token is created.
   <Aside type="tip">
     You will need the `Access Key ID`, `Secret Access Key` and the `S3
     endpoint` from this view. Save them.
   </Aside>
4. You can use the details from the previous step to configure Hostly.
