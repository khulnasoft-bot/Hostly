Health checks are important, but not mandatory for your application. It is a way to check if your application is started properly. Hostly provides a way to configure health checks for your application.

## How it works

If you set a health check, Hostly (and integrated proxy) will check the health of your application by sending a request to the health check endpoint.

Make sure to configure the health check against the container internal endpoint (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) and not against the domain (e.g. `https://mydomain.com`).

The integrated proxy only forwards the request to your application if the health check is successful. If the health check fails, the proxy will return a 502 Bad Gateway error.

## What if I do not set a health check?

You get a warning next to your application's status. It is not mandatory, but it is recommended to set a health check.
The integrated proxy will forward the request to your application without checking the health.
