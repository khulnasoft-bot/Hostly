You could add persistent storage to your resources, so you can preserve your data between deployments.

This persistent storage could be different in different types of Destinations.

## Docker Engine

If you are using Docker Engine, persistent storage could be a `volume` or a `bind mount` (a file/directory from the host system - your server).

### Volume

To create a volume, you need to define:

- `Name` of the volume.
- `Destination Path` where the volume will be mounted inside the container.

<Aside type="caution">
  The base directory inside the container is `/app`. So if you need to store
  your files under `storage` directory, you need to define `/app/storage` as the
  destination path.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  To prevent storage overlapping between resources, Hostly automatically adds
  the resource's UUID to the volume name.

### Bind Mount

To create a bind mount, you need to define:

- `Name` of the volume, which will be used as a reference.
- `Source Path` from the host system. **No docker volume created in this case.**
- `Destination Path` where the volume will be mounted inside the container.

<Aside type="caution">
  The base directory inside the container is `/app`. So if you need to store
  your files under `storage` directory, you need to define `/app/storage` as the
  destination path.

<Aside type="caution">
Share file between more than one container? **NOT RECOMMENDED.**

If you mount the same file to more than one container, you will need to make sure that the proper file locking mechanism is implemented in your resources.
