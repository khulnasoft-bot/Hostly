You could have a server with a non-root user that will manage your resources instead of the root user.

For this to work, you need to set up the server correctly.

## Requirements

- The non-root user needs to have the SSH key added to the server.
- Sudos permissions for the non-root user.

## Sudo permissions

You need to add the following lines to the `/etc/sudoers` file:

```bash
# Allow the your-non-root-user to run commands as root without a password
your-non-root-user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

This will allow the non-root user to any command as root without a password.
Note: you need to replace "your-non-root-user" with your user.

<Aside type="caution">
  This is not the most secure way to set up a non-root user, but we will improve
  this in the future, by adding more granular permissions on binaries.
