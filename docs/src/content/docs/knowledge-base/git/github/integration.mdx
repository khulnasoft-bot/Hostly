This guide will show you how to use GitHub based repositories with Hostly.

## Public Repositories

You can use public repositories without any additional setup.

1. Select the `Public repository` option in the Hostly when you create a new resource.
2. Add your repository URL to the input field, for example: `https://github.com/khulnasoft/hostly-examples`

<Aside type="caution">You can only use the https URL.</Aside>

3. That's it! Hostly will automatically pull the latest version of your repository and deploy it.

## Private Repositories

### With GitHub App (Recommended)

You can use private repositories with the GitHub App integration. You will get full integration with GitHub, like automatic commit deployments and pull request deployments.

1. Create a new GitHub App in the `Sources` view.
2. Create a new resource and select the `Private Repository (with GitHub App)`.
3. Choose your repository from the list.
4. That's it!

### With Deploy Keys

1. Add a private key (aka `Deploy Keys`) to Hostly and to your GitHub repository in the `Settings` / `Deploy Keys` menu.

<Aside type="caution">
  - You can generate a new key pair with the following command: 
  
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "deploy_key" 
  ```

  - Or you can also use Hostly to generate a new key for you in the `Keys & Tokens` menu.
</Aside>

2. Create a new resource and select the `Private Repository (with deploy key)`
3. Add your repository URL to the input field, for example: `git@github.com:khulnasoft/hostly-examples.git`

<Aside type="caution">You need to use the SSH URL, so the one that starts with `git@`.</Aside>

4. That's it!

## Automatic commit deployments with webhooks (Optional)

You can add a custom webhook URL to your GitHub repository to trigger a new deployment when you push to your repository.

<Aside type="caution">
This can be set on either public or private repositories.

Not required if you use GitHub App integration.

</Aside>

In your resource, there is a `Webhooks` menu. In the `Manual Git Webhooks` section, you can find the URL what you need to set in your GitHub repository.

1. Set a secret key in the `GitHub Webhook Secret` input field.
2. Go to your repository on GitHub and open the `Settings` / `Webhooks` menu.
3. Add the URL from Hostly to the `URL` input field and the secret token.
4. Select the `Push events` option.
5. That's it! Now when you push to your repository, GitHub will send a webhook request to Hostly and it will trigger a new deployment.

## Pull request deployments with webhooks (Optional)

You can add a custom webhook URL to your GitHub repository to trigger a new deployment when you create a new merge request.

<Aside type="caution">
This can be set on either public or private repositories.

Not required if you use GitHub App integration.

</Aside>

The process is the same as the previous one, but you need to select the `Pull Request` events option in the `Settings` / `Webhooks` menu.
