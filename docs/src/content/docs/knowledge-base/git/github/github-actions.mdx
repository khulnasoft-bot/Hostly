You can use GitHub Actions to build your image and deploy it to Hostly.

Here is an [example repository](https://github.com/andrasbacsai/github-actions-with-hostly) and a [workflow file](https://github.com/andrasbacsai/github-actions-with-hostly/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yaml) that you can check how it works.

## Process Overview

1. You need to create a [GitHub Action workflow](https://github.com/andrasbacsai/github-actions-with-hostly/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yaml) file in your repository.
2. You need to build your image and push it to a Docker registry. In the example, I use ghcr.io, but you can use any other registry.
3. You need to create a [Hostly API Token](/docs/api-reference/authorization) and add it to your GitHub repository secrets.
   - `HOSTLY_TOKEN` in the example.
4. In Hostly, you need to setup your deployment type. It could be a simple Dockerfile, Docker Compose or Docker Image based deployment.
5. Get the proper webhook endpoint from Hostly (Your resource / `Webhook` menu / `Deploy Webhook`) and add it to your GitHub repository secrets.
   - `HOSTLY_WEBHOOK` in the example.
6. Need to send a GET request to that webhook endpoint (authenticated with the token) to trigger the deployment
   - Example: `curl --request GET '${{ secrets.HOSTLY_WEBHOOK }}' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.HOSTLY_TOKEN }}'`
7. That's it! Now you can push to your repository and the deployment will be triggered automatically.
