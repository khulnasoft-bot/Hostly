This guide will show you how to use Gitea based repositories with Hostly.

## Public Repositories

You can use public repositories without any additional setup.

1. Select the `Public repository` option in the Hostly when you create a new resource.
2. Add your repository URL to the input field, for example: `https://gitea.com/heyandras/hostly-examples`

<Aside type="caution">You can only use the https URL.</Aside>

1. That's it! Hostly will automatically pull the latest version of your repository and deploy it.

## Private Repositories

Private repositories require a few more steps to setup.

1. Add a private key (aka `Deploy Keys`) to Hostly and to your Gitea repository in the `Repository Settings` / `Access Keys` menu.

<Aside type="caution">
  - You can generate a new key pair with the following command: 
  
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "deploy_key" 
  ```

  - Or you can also use Hostly to generate a new key for you in the `Keys & Tokens` menu.
</Aside>

2. Create a new resource and select the `Private Repository (with deploy key)`
3. Add your repository URL to the input field, for example: `git@gitea.com:heyandras/hostly-examples.git`

<Aside type="caution">You need to use the SSH URL, so the one that starts with `git@`.</Aside>

4. That's it! Hostly will automatically pull the latest version of your repository and deploy it.

## Automatic commit deployments with webhooks (Optional)

You can add a custom webhook URL to your Gitea repository to trigger a new deployment when you push to your repository.

<Aside type="caution">This can be set on either public or private repositories.</Aside>

In your resource, there is a `Webhooks` menu. In the `Manual Git Webhooks` section, you can find the URL what you need to set in your Gitea repository.

1. Set a secret key in the `Gitea Webhook Secret` input field.
2. Go to your repository in Gitea and open the `Repository Settings` / `Webhooks` menu as `Repository hooks`.
3. Add the URL from Hostly to the `URL` input field and the secret token.
4. Select the `Push` option.
5. That's it! Now when you push to your repository, Gitea will send a webhook request to Hostly and it will trigger a new deployment.

## Merge request deployments with webhooks (Optional)

You can add a custom webhook URL to your Gitea repository to trigger a new deployment when you create a new merge request.

<Aside type="caution">This can be set on either public or private repositories.</Aside>

The process is the same as the previous one. In the `Repository Settings` / `Webhooks` menu, you need to select the following events in the `Pull Request` option:

- `Created`
- `Updated`
- `Merged`
- `Declined`
